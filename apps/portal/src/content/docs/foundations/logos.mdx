Brand logos from the design system. Available in two versions:

- **Default Logos**: Full-color brand logos with background. These preserve the original brand colors and include a colored background with rounded corners. Use for prominent brand representation.
- **Logo Symbols**: Monochrome logo symbols using `currentColor`. These support CSS color styling and are ideal for lists, subtle UI contexts, or when brand colors would be too prominent.

## Default Logos

Full-color brand logos with background and 0.6px border.

<DocsPage.FigureGrid client:only type="logo" />

## Logo Symbols

Monochrome logo symbols using `currentColor`. Supports the following color variants via CSS:

- **default** — `text-cn-foreground-1` (primary text color)
- **muted** — `text-cn-foreground-2` (secondary text color)
- **neutral** — `text-cn-foreground-3` (tertiary text color)
- **currentColor** — inherits color from parent element
