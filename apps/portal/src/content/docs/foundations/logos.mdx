Brand logos for third-party services and integrations. Each logo is available in two variants optimized for different use cases.

## Overview

| Variant | Component | Use Case |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Default** | `LogoV2` | Prominent brand representation with original colors |
| **Symbol** | `LogoV2Symbol` | Subtle contexts, lists, monochrome UI |

## Default Logos

Full-color brand logos with colored background and subtle border. Use these when brand recognition is important.

**Features:**
- Original brand colors preserved
- Rounded corners (2px radius)
- Subtle inset border for definition
- Available in 4 sizes: `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`

<DocsPage.FigureGrid client:only type="logo" />

## Logo Symbols

Monochrome logo shapes using `currentColor`. These inherit color from CSS and are ideal for lists, navigation, or when brand colors would be too prominent.

**Features:**
- Uses `currentColor` for flexible styling
- No background — just the logo shape
- Supports color variants via component prop
- Available in 4 sizes: `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`

**Color variants:**
- **currentColor** — inherits from parent element
- **default** — primary text color (`text-cn-foreground-1`)
- **muted** — secondary text color (`text-cn-foreground-2`)
- **neutral** — tertiary text color (`text-cn-foreground-3`)

<DocsPage.FigureGrid client:only type="symbol" />
